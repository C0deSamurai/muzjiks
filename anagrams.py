"""This file allows you to find anagrams of tile sets, even with blanks. To avoid an O(n!) running
time complexity, a nonobvious algorithm is used. An anagram dictionary is created that assigns each
letter to a prime number and for every word multiplies together the various prime values of each
letter. In this way, if two words share a prime product they are anagrams, and vice versa.

You can access the dictionary simply by using anagram_dict, or the anagram() function."""
